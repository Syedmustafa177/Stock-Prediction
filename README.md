# Stock-Prediction
"I am thrilled to introduce my latest achievement: a cutting-edge Stock Prediction App developed using Python and Streamlit. This powerful tool harnesses the combined power of Python libraries such as Scikit-Learn, NLTK, and Pandas to provide comprehensive sentiment analysis for stock data extracted from news sources.

The app goes beyond conventional analysis by incorporating advanced features like tracking 100-day and 200-day moving averages, monitoring stock closing prices, and leveraging NLTK for predictive modeling. This holistic approach ensures that users gain valuable insights into stock trends and make informed investment decisions.

Join me in exploring the exciting world of stock prediction with this dynamic app, where data science meets financial intelligence!"
